# Angular 2 Starter Kit

## Description 

This is a seed project or template for your Angular 2 projects. Source code is based on TypeScript and uses npm to handle dependencies

## Install dependencies

To be able to start development you need to install a few dependencies. To do so, make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) installed. Once you have that, open a terminal in the project folder and run this command:

```bash
npm install # Install run dependencies
npm install -g tsd tsc lite-server # to compile and run
```
This command will run all scripts that are needed to install dependencies, including npm and jspm dependencies needed in order to compile and build the project.

## Building in development mode.

`tsc -w` to watch the typescript files
`lite-server` to run the live server
